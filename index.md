CoderDojo Course Dashboard
==========================

This is the course site of the [Slovenian CoderDojo](http://www.coderdojo.si) team.
The course is designed as a collection of tasks, ranging from easy to hard(ish),
that students must perform. This course demands a solid understanding of English language.

→ [Student Tasks](tasks.html)

Completion of each task results in, aside from the knowledge gain, increased
high score on the leaderboard.

please register first by filling the form below.
