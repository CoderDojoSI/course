This is the course site of the [Slovenian CoderDojo](http://www.coderdojo.si) team.
The course is designed as a collection of tasks, ranging from easy to hard(ish),
that students must perform. This course demands a solid understanding of English language.

→ [English Tasks](tasks.html) / [Slovenske Naloge](tasks-sl.html)

Completion of each task results in, aside from the knowledge gain, 
increased high score on the [leaderboard](leaderboard.html).

If you own a tablet or another smart and mobile device, you are
well-advised to play some of these curated, fun-guaranteed
[educational **mobile games**](educational-mobile-games.html).
