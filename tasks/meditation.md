* never be lonely,
* never get sick,
* sleep better,
* have a boosted memory,
* live for hundreds of years,
* be better at everything you do,

Vipassana meditation technique
------------------------------
One meditation technique is called _Vipassana meditation_ which is the
method taught prominently by _Gautama Buddha_. It goes roughly like this:

1. You sit comfortably and relax.
2. Focus on your respiration (breathing).
   Observe how when you _inhale_, your navel goes outwards as your chest cavity expands,
   stop for a moment,
   and when you ever so *slowly* _exhale_, notice your heart rhythm settling
   at a natural level.
3. While respiring softly as you do naturally, observe the air flow through your **nostrils**
   and the feeling it is creating.
4. Repeat step 3.
5. When, after a while, you first notice that, in fact, you are now thinking
   about something completely different, a past or future or potential errand or event or such,
   become aware of it and just **calmly return to step 2**.

When you meditate for the first time, your timespan between steps 3 and 5
may be only seconds long. With practice, you can increase this time to minutes
as a first direct measure of your meditation success.

###### Remember ######
5 minutes of meditation a day is great, but so are three deep slow breaths in and out with your eyes closed.
