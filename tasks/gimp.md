title: Photoshop images with the GiMP
---
{{ page.title }}
================

The [GiMP](http://www.gimp.org/) stands for
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html) Image Manipulation Program.
Unlike Adobe's Photoshop, **GiMP is completely free to use** for any purpose, 
and it has similar (but superior) capabilities.

Proficiency in image editing is a useful skill to have.

a few [pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) large), **forge official
documents**, <s>draw tits on</s>tamper with a picture of your best friend, avoid shoops like
[these](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/23371-this-looks-shopped), ...
