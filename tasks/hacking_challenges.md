Task
----

Your task is to review all the sites (provide feedback to your instructors!),
then register on [WeChall](http://www.wechall.net/),
which is sort of a **score-tracking hub across all such challenge sites**.

Then, you can register on any other of those sites and **do their challenges**.
(You can also work on WeChall challenges first.) Most sites will require
a registration before you can view the challenges, but let that not deter you from
reviewing all the sites carefully. Some challenges will likely be over
your head (and even your all-knowing instructors couldn't solve them), some
you should find fairly easy to moderate.

It depends on **how good a hacker you want to become**. `;)`
