Play programming games
======================

How wonderful is to learn that you can **discover all the mysteries of
programming** by playing a couple of very entertaining puzzle games?

Well, you can.

Task
----
Complete all of the following games in given order and with associated criteria:
* [light-Bot 2](http://educative-games.org/#programming/light-bot-2)
  (at least **80% of tutorial levels** and **3 staff-picked** user-submitted levels),
* [Jahooma's LogicBox](http://educative-games.org/#programming/jahoomas-logicbox)
  (at least **75% of available levels**),
* [RoboZZle](http://robozzle.com/js/) (any **5 levels**).

Let the fun begin!

You can, of course, **play these games at home** or whenever it's convenient for you.
But you **must be able to provide proof of completion** for each game.
The best way to achieve this is to always use the same computer when playing
so that your progress is saved in a cookie,
or take lots of screenshots (e.g. a working solution on each level).

**You must not follow public walkthroughs**.
If you are found to have been following walkthroughs
everybody will know this and
you will gain **no points for this task**, to say the least.
Consider _not cheating_ your value of honor, while all the **more benefiting and fun**!
