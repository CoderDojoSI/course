Create GitHub account
=====================

Visit the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and create an account.

You may ask what have you gained by creating a GitHub account?
Here are a few thinkgs:
 - A place for your code on the web
 - Ability to share your code with other GitHub users
 - Ability to change code of other users
 - Having the history of all the changes that you and/or other people make to the code

 You might feel some confusion, you may have no idea what or how to do anything. Don't give up, with practice you will get used to the ideas that GitHub offers.
