Create a GitHub account
=====================

Visit the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and create an account.

What will you gain by using a [VCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control)?

Here are a few things:
 - Free hosting of your code and projects. ( [free blog, anyone?](http://jekyllrb.com/) )
 - Showcasing your projects, allowing competent people to contact / hire you.
 - Contributing to open source projects.
 - Having the history of all the changes that you and/or other people make to the code. ( Especially the bad ones )

For a quick demo/tutorial/course you can visit [this page](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1/) or [this one](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_01.html/), and get a quick feel of what GitHub is about.
