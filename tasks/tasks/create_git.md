Use GitHub as source code repository
====================================

When working of projects involving repeated modification of text files 
(such as source code or documentation texts), you may wish to 
**distribute work, track changes, assign versions, keep a history** 
that you can inspect and look back in.

Task
----
Visit the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and create an account.

To get started with Git, follow any or all of these tutorials:
* http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1/
* http://gitimmersion.com/lab_01.html
* http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/git/

Having a GitHub account will allow you to:
* host freely your code, projects, and [websites](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/),
* showcase your projects (as in _portfolio_), allowing people to contact/hire you,
* contribute to many, many open-source projects,
* maintain a history of all changes that you or other people make to the code. (So you can blame them for it not working.)

You **should use GitHub** repositories for all your programming projects, and
you should be familiar at least with the following `git` commands:
```
git init   - for creating a new repository
    clone  - for cloning an existing repository
    status - see what files are modified since the previous commit
    diff   - see the changes exactly
    add    - add the file into version control (track it)
    commit - commit changes into the repository
    log    - see the backlog of all commits
    push   - push the commits from your local repository to the origin
    pull   - pull changes (by others) into your local repository
    help   - see the program usage and help
```
You should also familiarize yourself with the GitHub interface, and **you will
be quizzed** on these subjects.
