Create an email address
=======================

To sign up with various online services, you need an address where you can
be reached.  What better than an email address.

As this task, you need to create an email account with Google.

Note that you address will look like:
```
<your.desired.username>@gmail.com
```
You may wish to choose your desired username wisely. If so, your handle may
accompany you for until you get weary of it, with much of your history at
your hands indefinitely.  Counsel with your instructors.

Since this is an account as important as your e-mail (right above your bank
account!), it's reasonable to **set a strong and unique password** on it.
**You MUST NOT USE THIS PASSWORD ON ANY OTHER ONLINE SERVICE that you sign up with.**

Task
----
You may wish to **read the following guides** first:
* [The Conscience of a Hacker](http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&id=3&mode=txt)
* [How to Lie to People: Achieving Anonymity Through Disinformation and Data Poisoning](http://www.textfiles.com/uploads/howtolie.txt)
* [Advice From a Hacker on Picking a Good Password](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/08/advice-hacker-password-security-best-practices/56343/)

Then [create a new Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp)
if you haven't already.

Confirm completion of this task by sending an email to
`coderdojo-instructors@coderdojo.si` with the subject line `New recruit reporting`
and message text:
```
Hi,
My name is <YOUR FULL NAME>, I come from <YOUR CITY>, <COUNTRY>, and I will be
attending future CoderDojo events. This written statement is considered a contract
and is binding as permitted by applicable law.

My e-mail is: <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>

Best Regards
```
The email must be exactly as shown, otherwise it won't be accepted. You have one
shot at this. It is very complicated. You have been warned.

What you will acquire
---------------------
* A basis of all other online activity.
* Reading above guides in full will equip you with eternal ability to distinct
  'good' and 'bad' passwords, and knowledge of best practices when creating
  online accounts.
