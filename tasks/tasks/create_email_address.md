Create an email address
=======================

To sign up with various online services, you need an address where you can
be reached.  What better than an email address.

As this task, you need to create an email account with Google.

Note that you address will look like:
```
<your.desired.username>@gmail.com
```
You may wish to choose your desired username wisely. If so, your handle may
accompany you for until you get weary of it, with much of your history at
your hands indefinitely.  Counsel with your instructors.

Since this is an account as important as your e-mail (right above your bank
account!), it's reasonable to **set a strong and unique password** on it.
**You MUST NOT USE THIS PASSWORD ON ANY OTHER ONLINE SERVICE that you sign up with.**
