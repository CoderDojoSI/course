Create a HTML5 Game
=================

Before jumping in, you should read the following article first.
[Getting started with HTML5 game development](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/09/getting-started-with-html5-game-development/)

Upon finishing the link above, you can proceed [here](https://github.com/DaRaFF/jsgamewiki) to decide on what to start.

### Below text should be changed accordingly, if it will remain unchanged for a few days I will assume no one cares and JUDGE IT WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY.

If you have already created you own website you might wish to add a game to it.
This game will be using a Canvas and some JavaScript code for manipulating our Canvas.

[This is the tutorial we will be using](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/)

Follow the tutorial to get a basic idea of how to create a canvas HTML5 game. This is the easy part.
Try changing stuff in your upcoming game, add different images, try changing the style of your game. Play around with the code!

The more the game will differ from the tutorial the better.
