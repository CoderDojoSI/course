Learn GIMP
==========

[GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) stands for GNU Umage Manipulation Program.
Unlike more known Photoshop it is free to use and has similar capabilities.

Editing images might not be related to programing, but it is an useful tool when you might want to create a character for your game (even if he is just a few pixels high and a few pixels wide).

On [this link](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/) you can find general tutorials for gimp (not really related to anything special in game design).

You can even cut objects out of the pictures you made and use them in your software. Here is a quick tutorial on how to take pictures that are good for using as textures: [Texture Photography](http://www.hourences.com/tutorials-texture-photography/)
