The Unix Koans of Master Foo
============================

Most people view **_Unix_** as a set of
**[guidances on how to build computer software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)**.
Its [legacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) spans into 1970s, and Unix
has made much of today's computing possible.
Various open standards such as _POSIX_ standards for portable operating
systems, _Single UNIX Specification_, and
[_Filesystem Hierarchy Standard_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard#Directory_structure),
established by various open groups, along with
**the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
have made the machines we use today so great**!

Task
----

  1. Read the Wikipedia article on the
     [philosophy of Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
     Verbally reiterating the commandments before bedtime will demonstrably
     make you the **best** programmer!
  2. Read [The Unix Koans of Master Foo](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/).
     These are short, fun, and intelligent **stories with hidden meanings**,
     and each contains a wise lesson, so you may like them.
