==============================

Create the smartest **artificial intelligence** for your **army of warrior ants**.

[![aichallenge game](https://github.com/CoderDojoSI/ideas/raw/master/tasks/resources/aichallenge_ants.png)](http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=346330)

**Note**: To have it more fun and interesting, this task should only be
attempted if there is **enough group interest** (4+ participants), so you can
play against your friends.

Task
----
Follow through all the 'Getting Started' guides on
[AI Challenge website](http://aichallenge.org), especially the
[Ants Tutorial](http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial.php)!

Then use the [Starter kit](http://aichallenge.org/starter_packages.php) to
implement [innovative strategies](http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewforum.php?f=24) and
write award-winning ants' AI in [your favorite programming language](learn_python.md).

**Note**: If you absolutely can't find 4 participants to tackle your ants,
you can **write AI for [realtimebattle robots](http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/)
instead**. This you can do yourself.
Above instructions don't apply. Instead, there is this
[documentation](http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/Documentation/RealTimeBattle.html).
