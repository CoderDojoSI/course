Programming problems
======================

Now that you know some basic programming, preferably in
[Python](learn_python.md), solving some real-world problems is in order.

If you're interested in such a thing, on these sites you can find
general problems relevant to the field of **mathematics**:

Or if those problems prove to be too hard for you to understand
(i.e. you are not smart enough), try some of these, easy ones:

Task
----

Solve any problem.

Proportionate to its difficulty, each and every
problem solved counts.
