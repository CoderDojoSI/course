Create your first HTML website
==============================

At the end of this task, you should have your very own website, written in **HTML**,
styled up to highest aesthetic standards with **CSS**,
and with interactive dynamic content written in **JavaScript**.

What exactly do you need for this endeavor?
Well, it turns out all you need is a [text editor](http://www.geany.org/) and
a web browser.
(If you are using Internet Explorer, you need to download a sensible browser
like [Firefox](http://affiliates.mozilla.org/link/banner/44894) or
[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/)).

What exactly is HTML anyway? It's an _abbrevation_ that stands for:
Hyper-Text Mark-up Language (a [quick explanation](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson2.php)).
In practice, it's very much like [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), which you should know a little about as well.

Task
----
Now it's time to **start building your website**.
The **content** of your website is totally up to you: we recommend collecting
some material about the topic that you wish to present,
like **pictures**, **text**ual content, **video**, **lists** of items, etc.
**Content is king.**

Put all those _resources_ in a folder on your hard drive. This will be the base
folder of your website. Now create an empty file `index.html` in that folder.

This empty file will soon contain some text. The text you will populate it with.

To get an understanding of how HTML is normally applied and
to get a feel about its structure, read the following links:
* [Elements and Tags in HTML](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson3.php)
* [Create your first website](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson4.php)

Now dive in deeply by following **any one** of these fine manuals in whole:
* [Continue with the HTML.net tutorial](http://html.net/tutorials/html/)
* [HTMLDog's Beginner HTML Tutorial](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/)
* [Learning HTML for Kids!](http://www.goodellgroup.com/tutorial/toc.html)

Finally, become up-to-date with [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html) tutorial.

Now what's up with _cascading style sheets_ aka. _CSS_?

You **style your webpages with CSS**: determine the font, sizes of elements, colors, backgrounds, offsets and margins...
Here's a good, short CSS tutorial for you:
* http://www.w3schools.com/css/

And then there is JavaScript, the dynamic runtime of today's Web.
JavaScript is a programming language, unlike HTML ([mark-up language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)) and CSS (declarative language).
If you've gone over the [fun introduction to programming and JavaScript](javascript_fun.md)
continue through the [W3Schools JavaScript tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/js/).

And this is it of the basics. `:)`

**Happy experimenting**! That's all you need to do,
experiment and see what happens.

You can use these interactive instant-feedback HTML+CSS+JavaScript editors
for experimenting:
* [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/welcome/1/edit)
* [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)

But **always save your progress** to the hard disk, so you will be able to **recall it later if needed**.

**Remember**: [W3Schools' HTML reference](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/)
is an invaluable resource.
There's also a [CSS property reference](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/),
[CSS selectors reference](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp), and
[JavaScript reference](www.w3schools.com/jsref/).
