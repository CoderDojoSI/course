Create interactive stories in Scratch
=====================================

Scratch is playful tool that introduces a young mind to the ways of
analytical problem solving through building interactive stories with
basic programming building blocks.

If you're not familiar with it yet,
here's a [video introduction to Scratch](http://vimeo.com/29457909).

Task
----
See some example games that others made in Scratch:
* [Newton's Orbital Cannon](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11882821/)
* [Dodge the Barrel](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11642040/)
* [World's Greatest Text Engine](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11850094/)
* [Interactive School Map with Zoom](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11629464/)

Now don't go about playing that games all day, **you've got your own game to do**!

[Scratch on-line editor](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted)

How does one do a game like above in Scratch?

Your instructors surely don't know.
But perhaps you can figure it out by first following some Scratch tutorials:
* [Scratch 1: Motion, sounds, repeating actions, sprites, speaking, image effects, ...](http://learnscratch.org/scratch-1)
* [Scratch 2: Blocks overview and reference](http://learnscratch.org/scratch-2)
* [Scratch 3: Case studies of some good Scratch projects](http://learnscratch.org/scratch-3)
* [MIT introductory tutorials](http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Video_Tutorials)
* [Basic Scratch video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkhjX792yVI)
* [Advanced Game-making in Scratch](http://www.teach-ict.com/programming/scratch/scratch_home.htm)

Your task it to **create Scratch On-Line account** and
then **create your own mini-game**. Anything you'd like.

**Note**: If you are already **very experienced in Scratch** and
have an **idea for a really _unique_ and fun game**, maybe you should consider
making it in [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com/) instead.
