Digital audio fundamentals and editing with Audacity
====================================================

Audacity is a [free and open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), 
cross-platform program for recording and editing sounds. [Screenshots](https://www.google.com/search?q=audacity+screenshot&tbm=isch).

You will learn how computer sound 'works', how it is represented, and how to
modify and tweak it to sound exactly as you'd like.

Task
----
First you need to **learn about digital audio fundamentals**. These
sources will explain the basics of the field:
* http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/Digital_Audio
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio
* [LoudnessWar: Audio Fundamentals Course](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF323DDC21E6DC960)

You can use these applet to visualize what sounds look like:

* http://www.falstad.com/mathphysics.html (Acoustics section)

When you have a grasp of how digital audio works, go through the Tutorials
section of [Audacity wiki](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/Main_Page) to learn
how to use the program to easily modify or convert just any sound ever with
just a few clicks.

For a successful completion of this task, you are required to
1. **record a sentence** in your own voice, then
2. use Audacity to **raise the pitch** (tone) of your voice but
   **don't make the recording any shorter** (or faster)!

Show the result to your instructors. If you are working in pairs, **have the
instructors guess** who made the recording. Your job is to trick them!
