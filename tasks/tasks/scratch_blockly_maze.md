Navigate the Blockly Maze
=========================

A Google employee, Neil Fraser, has during his [journaled trip to Vietnam](https://neil.fraser.name/news/2013/03/16/)
coded a nice little [web-based Scratch-like environment](http://blockly-demo.appspot.com/)
that lightly introduces the most **important basic building blocks** of most
modern **programming languages**:
* statements,
* loops,
* conditional expressions, and
* variable assignment.

Task
----
Complete the [Blockly Maze programming puzzle](http://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/apps/maze/index.html).

For maximum points, you are required to **_export_ your solutions for
mazes 7, 8, 9, and 10**. You can export your solutions with a "Share" link
(![link](https://github.com/CoderDojoSI/ideas/raw/master/tasks/resources/blockly_link_icon.png) icon).
Save the exported solutions and **show them (only!) to
your instructors**.
