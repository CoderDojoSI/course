Learn JavaScript the fun way
============================

**JavaScript**, which is **completely unrelated to Java** programming language,
is the **dynamic driving force of modern web pages**. Most interactive stuff
you see on the web is as a result of JavaScript code executing in your
browser. Even major modern games are written in (HTML5 and) JavaScript,
so you should know at least some of it.
