Install software (programs) on your GNU/Linux system
====================================================

Smart people know [GNU/Linux is better than Windows](http://whylinuxisbetter.net/).
Software in GNU/Linux systems is **organized in packages**, and when you
need a certain program, you install that program's package.  Unlike in
Windows, you don't go online and search and test and trial demo software
(mostly [malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) that slows down your PC), instead you run **synaptic**,
the _package manager_, and just mark the package for installation.

In GNU/Linux, there is:
* no need to senslessly click 'Next' button half-a-dozen of times during the install procedure,
* no need to 'I Agree' to suspicious licences,
* no need to input long, convoluted registration codes,
* no need to illegally download pirated software through BitTorrent networks.

This is what the **synaptic** dashboard looks like:

* [How to install packages in Synaptic Package Manager](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQgOxpG8vLY)

If you, for some reason, need additional guidance, follow
[Ubuntu's Synaptic How-to](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto) or
read the chapter _Nameščanje programskih paketov_, page 94, of
[_Linux na namizju_](http://dk.fdv.uni-lj.si/ek/pdfs/ek_kovacic_2010_Linux_na_namizju.pdf) (Slovene, PDF) book.

You can also run synaptic from the command line (terminal),
by typing: `sudo synaptic`.

Your task is to **install the package _passage_**,
a game about the passage through life.

Run the game as proof of completion.

Learn to maintain. After you're done, if you don't like the game, do **remove it from your system**.

**Remember**: Your operating system is a derivative of Debian, so when you install software from the web, 
you should install packages made for preferrably 
![debian logo](https://github.com/CoderDojoSI/ideas/raw/master/tasks/resources/debian-logo-icon.png) **Debian** (*.deb), if available.
