Learn Python
============

Programming is most of all fun! Everybody should learn **at least some** programming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many [programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
available today, and the choice is vast, but with this task, we will focus
on Python. Python is the simplest programming language around and it's in the 
lead by power to simplicity ratio. You will learn it now.

Task
----
_Complete_ any of the following courses (or complete several for more points!):
* [Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3)
* [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html)
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* [A Byte of Python](http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/) (Chapters 8–17 apply)
* [Hands-on Python Tutorial](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html)

You are advised to first **take the time to** skim through all the tutorials and
thoroughly **evaluate** them by language, clarity, overall length, and depth of covered 
material. You are likely to expect any of these tutorials to take you **at least
a week or two to complete** (depending solely on the level of your enthusiasm, of course),
so better choose well-informed and wisely.
Note that any **feedback you should provide to to your instructors** will help
them pick better tutorials for you in the future.

If you experince difficulty in understanding any of the provided examples,
or if you don't completely understand what your Python code is doing,
see if you can help yourself by using this
[Python Tutor Visualization tool](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html).

Only _after you have completed_ at least one of the above tutorials, you can
deepen your knowledge (not to mention earn extra points!) by completing also at least any one of these:
* [Beginning Game Programming for Teens with Python](http://www.raywenderlich.com/24252/beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python)
* [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/)
* [py4fun: Building a GUI Application with Tkinter](http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/gui/tkPhone.html)
* [py4fun: Programming a video game](http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/lode/lode.html)

Note that you should always write your Python code mostly conformant to 
[PEP-8 style guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), and **preferrably 
in English** (when naming variables, classes, ...).

Finally, you should read [The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), 
and see if you can now explain any of the contained koans.

What you will acquire
---------------------
* You will learn to program in one of the best programming languages, Python.
* You will be able to dive into further documentation and create command-line
  programs, scripts, full-windowed applications, games, ...
