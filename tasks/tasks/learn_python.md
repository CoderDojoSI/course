Learn Python
============

Programming is most of all fun! Everybody should learn **at least some** programming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many [programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
available today, and the choice is vast, but with this task, we will focus
on Python. Python is the simplest programming language around and it's in the 
lead by power to simplicity ratio. You will learn it now.

Task
----
_Complete_ any of the following courses (or complete several for more points!):
* [Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3)
* [A Byte of Python](http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/) book (only Chapters 8–17 apply)
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html)
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* [Hands-on Python Tutorial](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html)

You are advised to first take the time to skim through all the tutorials and
thoroughly **evaluate** them by language, clarity, overall length, and depth of covered 
material. You are likely to expect any of these tutorials to take you at least
a week or two to complete (depending solely on the level of your enthusiasm),
so better choose well-informed and wisely.
Bear in mind that any **feedback you should provide to to your instructors** 
will help them pick better tutorials for you in the future.

Only after you have _completed_ at least one of the above tutorials, you can
deepen your knowledge (an earn extra points) by choosing at least one of these:
* [py4fun: Building a GUI Application with Tkinter](http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/gui/tkPhone.html)
* [py4fun: Programming a video game](http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/lode/lode.html)
* [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/)

Note that you should write your Python code mostly conformant to 
[PEP-8 style guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), and preferrably 
in English (when naming variables, classes, ...).

Finally, you should read [The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), 
and see if you can explain any of the contained koans.

What you will acquire
---------------------
* You will learn to program in one of the best programming languages, Python.
* You will be able to dive into further documentation and create command-line
  programs, scripts, full-windowed applications, games, ...
