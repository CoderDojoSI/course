Primitive data types
====================

Variables and types are two concepts shared by most
[programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language).
**_Variables_** are kind of like **reserved spaces** for **_values_** of
certain **_type_**. Each variable has a _name_ and associated _value_, which can be an
* integer — e.g. -45, 0, 1, 202, ...
* floating point number — e.g. 3.14, 0.0007, 2e10, ...
* character — e.g. 'a', 'b', ...
* string — a series of characters
* object — some composite object that is itself composed of values of different types,
* ...
Different programming languages expose different primitive data types,
for example, Python has `list` (a list of objects) and `dict` (a [hash table](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0)
of objects) and many more types.

Example
-------
variable name | variable type | example value (in variable)
------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------
counter       | int           | 2
hello_text    | str           | "Hello, world!"
PI            | float         | 3.1415926
list_of_ints  | list          | \[1, 2, 0, 4\]

The choice of **variable name** lies with the programmer. The code is only readable when names are chosen wisely.

Task
----
Your task is to get familiar with basic data types that are available in
almost all programming languages, regardless of your preference.

**Read the [full Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type)**
on topic and possibly follow all the linked pages too.

Use LibreOffice Calc (a solid Microsoft Excel replacement) to **create a spreadsheet**
of [tabular information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_%28information%29)
comparing different popular types.

Some of the **information you MUST include** is:
* **common type names** across various computer languages (Python, C, Java, ... — Google it!),
* **length** of objects of certain type (in [bytes](http://simplyted.blogspot.com/2005/12/how-to-visualize-data.html)),
* **for what kind of data** can the type be used **most effectively**,
* basic **operations** that _could_ be executed upon type,
* **for what kind of data** the type **shouldn't be used** (due to
  **logical of performant ineffectivenes** in that situation).

You are welcome to include your own notes and remarks. Once finished,
submit the spreadsheet for evaluation.
