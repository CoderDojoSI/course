Join us on IRC
==============

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat and was the standard text-based
communication protocol before various _instant messengers_ like MSN Messenger,
GTalk, or Skype were developed.

Many skilled computer users communicate via IRC because it
offers them real-time asynchronous communication that isn't
scrutinized by a large corporate entity and it [doesn't lock them
in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) into a single client

We, the CoderDojo Slovenia team, too use IRC for communication purposes!

Task
----
Join us on IRC, that is
```
 irc://chat.freenode.org:7000/#coderdojo.si
 \_/   \_______________/ \__/ \___________/
  |           |           |     |
 protocol   server      port  channel
```

You can set up to autojoin **#coderdojo.si** in your favorite IRC client,
such as multi-protocol [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) or similar:
* https://www.google.com/search?q=pidgin+set+up+irc
* https://www.google.com/search?q=pidgin+irc+autojoin

You can [check the room out online](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23coderdojo.si),
but we strongly advise setting it up in a standalone client.

The points for this task are only awarded
**when you have been seen [lurking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker)**
in the channel relatively frequently for **at least month**, and/or you
show **above-average activity** in the channel, and/or you significantly
**contribute to the channel** in some other way,
like help with the [channel's bot](irc_bot.md).
