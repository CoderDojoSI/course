Learn Ruby
----------

Ruby is a newly popular interpreted language from Japan. Unlike [Python](learn_python.md),
which is a general-purpose language used in scientific computing, web, game,
and application development, Ruby is as of yet mostly used for building
[_server-side_ backends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) of websites.

Otherwise, Ruby is as [_powerful_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power)
as any other language, and everything that can be computed, can also be computed in Ruby.
