Computer Science: University-level Course
=========================================

Computer science is often difficult to define. As you are perhaps aware,
computer science is not simply the study of computers. Although computers play
an important supporting role as a tool in the discipline, they are just that
— tools.

Computer science is the study of **problems**, problem-solving,
and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process.
Given a problem, a computer scientist’s goal is to develop an **_algorithm_**,
a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise.
Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem.
**Algorithms are solutions**.

Computer science can be thought of as the study of algorithms.

Computer science is not the study of programming, whch is an important
part of what a computer scientist does.
Programming is often the way that we create a representation for our solutions.

Preconditions
-------------
You MUST complete [computational thinking](computational_thinking.md) task
before this one, and some basic [Python](python.md) won't do harm either.

Task
----
Read the following short sections:
* [What is computer science?](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/introduction.html#what-is-computer-science)
* [What is Programming](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/introduction.html#what-is-programming)
* [Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/introduction.html#why-study-data-structures-and-abstract-data-types)
* [Why Study Algorithms?](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/introduction.html#why-study-algorithms)

Now follow one of these computer science **programs**:
* [Computer Science < Saylor.org](http://www.saylor.org/majors/computer-science/)

Each program consists of several **courses** that you need to complete. And each
course consists of **units** that will each take you a couple of hours to
complete. You need not follow everything, but it would make sense to **examine
at least 2/3 or 75% of each course** material.

Note that by this, you will be gaining **knowledge soon far surpassing that of your
instructors**, if only you are ready to dedicate to it a couple of weeks.
