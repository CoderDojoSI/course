Visual Programming of Mobile Apps
=================================

Want to make an app that runs on mobile platforms, like
[Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29) or
[iOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) or
[FirefoxOS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) or
[Ubuntu Mobile](http://www.ubuntu.com/phone)?

Code them!

If you want to make an app for Android, code it in Java.
If you want to make it for iOS, code it in Objective-C.
If you want to make it for other platforms, you can use HTML+JavaScript.
**What a mess**!

**If you want to make a mobile app**, use a visual programming tool that is
**language and platform-agnostic** (builds apps that are _cross-platform_).

Task
----
Learn your options. You can use
* [MIT AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) (recommended),
* [Bryan Lunduke's visual software creator/make-inator](http://lunduke.com/?page_id=3454),
* [appery.io](http://appery.io/).

If you choose MIT AppInventor, which is very similar to [Scratch](scratch.md),
**you should follow [this AppInventor guide](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/android-beginner-app-inventor)**.
Unfortunately, AppInventor apps (at the time of writing) work with Android OS only.

After becoming well-acquainted with the tool, now **build a real mobile app** of your own.
It can be **about anything**, but imagine it first. It has to have certain
above-banal **complexity** and it has to be either **useful** or **fun**!
