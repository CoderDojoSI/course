Photoshop images with the GiMP
==============================

The [GiMP](http://www.gimp.org/) stands for [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html) Image Manipulation Program.
Unlike Adobe's Photoshop, **GiMP is completely free to use** for any purpose, 
and it has similar (but superior) capabilities.

Proficiency in image editing is a useful skill to have.
You need not become an expert to **draw your own in-game characters** (even if only

documents**, ~~draw tits on~~tamper with a picture of your best friend, avoid shoops like
