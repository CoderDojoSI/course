Lockpicking: Opening locks without using a key
==============================================

We guard our homes, safes, belongings with locks.  Locks that we trust
will prevent unauthorized users (who don't possess the correct key) from
obtaining what we consider our property.

But how safe are mechanical locks really?


Task
----
You will try to open a classical **cylindrical lock**.
The required **lockpicking tools should be provided** by your instructors,
but you have to **bring your own locks**
(bring all old locks you can find around the house!).
You will try to unlock (or _pick_) those locks with lockpicks.

Study the lock mechanism until you understand how it works:

Then get your skilled little fingers ready for some **gentle, touchy-feely**
picking.

Extra credit when you **open the locks with self-made tools**, e.g.
tension wrench and lockpicks from hair pins or paper clips.
