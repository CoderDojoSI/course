Create your first HTML website
==============================

In the end of this task you will have your very own website.

What exactly do you need for this endeavor?
Well for building a HTML website all you need is a text editor.


What exactly is HTML anyway? Well it is just an abbrevation that stands for:
Hyper Text Mark-Up Language

A quick explanation can be found on [this link](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson2.php)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have a basic idea of what HTML is supposed to be, we can start building our website.
The content of a website that you wish to make is totally up to you.
Try collecting some pictures about the topic that you wish to present.

When you have an idea and collection of some content (like pictures, articles, video, etc.), create a folder for your website.
In that folder we will create a file named: index.html

This empty file will soon contain some text.

To get an understanding of how HTML is supposed to look and to get a feel about its structure read the following links:

I wish you happy experimenting with HTML, that is all you need to do. Experiment and see what different elements of HTML do.

And remember [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) is an invaluable resource, not just for [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) but also for [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) (for pretty colors and shapes) and [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) (for creating dynamic content).
