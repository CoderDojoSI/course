Create your first HTML website
==============================

At the end of this task, you should have your very own website.

What exactly do you need for this endeavor?
Well, all you need for building an HTML website is a [text editor](http://www.geany.org/).

What exactly is HTML anyway? It's an _abbrevation_ that stands for:
Hyper-Text Mark-up Language (a [quick explanation](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson2.php)).


Task
----
Now that you have a basic idea of what HTML is supposed to be, you can **start
building your website**.
The content of your website is totally up to you: we recommend collecting
some material about the topic that you wish to present,
like **pictures**, **text**ual content, **video**, **lists** of items, etc.

Put all those _resources_ in a folder on your hard drive. This will be the base
forlder of your website. Now in that folder, create an empty file `index.html`.

This empty file will soon contain some text. The text you will populate it with.

To get an understanding of how HTML is normally applied and
to get a feel about its structure, read the following links:
* [Elements and Tags in HTML](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson3.php)
* [Create your first website](http://html.net/tutorials/html/lesson4.php)

Now dive in deeply by following **any one** of these fine manuals:
* [Continue with the HTML.net tutorial](http://html.net/tutorials/html/)
* [HTMLDog's Beginner HTML Tutorial](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/)
* [Learning HTML for Kids!](http://www.goodellgroup.com/tutorial/toc.html)

Finally, you can update the knowledge with [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html) tutorial.

**Happy experimenting** with HTML! That's all you need to do,
experiment and see what different HTML elements do.

You can use these interactive instant-feedback HTML+CSS+JavaScript editors
for experimenting:
* [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/welcome/1/edit)
* [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)

But **always save your progress** to hard disk, so you will be able to **recall it later if needed**.

**Tip**: [W3Schools' HTML reference](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
is an invaluable resource.
Also look at [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) (for making pretty colors and shapes), 
and some [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) (for programming dynamic, changing content).
