Start writing your own we**_b log_**
====================================

It seems everyone wants to be a famous _writer_ today.

By starting to write [blogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) you are
well looking into improving your constructive thought process and writing
skills. If you don't look good, at least you can be well-spoken, well-read,
and – obviously – well-written.

Here are some failsafe recipes that will show you **how to write a blog** that
might eventually become famous enough to even earn you a decent
living all by itself:

Task
----
First decide on **what your blog will be about**. Most personal blogs are
about **personal stuff that interest you** and might (hopefully) interest others.

Now **find an appropriate name** for your blog. It should be something 
**fun and memorable**, as applies in general when picking domain names.
The name you choose will be part of the domain name (URL) of your blog website.
Think this through. If unsure, seek feedback from instructors.

Go to [Blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com) and sign-in with your Google account.
Create a new blog with your selected name and head on to writing your first post.

Now **customize your blog thoroughly** through the Blogger dashboard.
You should be going for a rather relatively **unique and functional style**.

Finally, continue to **post on your blog regularly**.

You get points for completion of this task when you have at least 10 blog posts
with at least 150 words each, spanning at least 40 days.

Happy [creative writing](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Good-Story)! `;)`
