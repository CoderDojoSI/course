=========================================

In this task you will get to know the basics of PyGame module and in the end you'll have a functional game.
We will be using [this tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/24252/beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python).

Tutorial will take you on a journey through some basic functions that make up a PyGame game.

You will learn how to move your character, update the screen, how to "listen" for key presses and much more.

Have fun learning PyGame and we are sure that this knowledge will help you in later game development.
