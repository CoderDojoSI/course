OCR images with tesseract-ocr
=============================

_OCR_ stands for [_optical character recognition_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)
and it is the science about recognizing text in images. Computers
can't "natively" read text from images because:
* text is a stream of characters, where each character is represented with
  [up to four bytes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) (depending on the
  [_character encoding_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding)),
* images are compressed streams of pixel values (colors), without any
  computer-readable description of what the image depicts.

**Note**: The "hardness" of OCR problem is exactly the reason why you see all
those [CAPTCHAs everywhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=captcha&tbm=isch).
They are meant to prevent automated computer submissions (e.g. thousands of
requests per second, generated by a script you made).

Tesseract-OCR, developed by Google, is a free and open-source tool for
reading text from images.


Task
----
Your task is to write a tool **on top of** tesseract-ocr.
Your program (coded in Python or Bash) must accept a **PDF or image file on input**,
and provide clean and **as correct as possible text representation on output**.

Your program should **use the tesseract-ocr for most of the work**,
so get to know the _documentation_ of tesseract-ocr well.

First try to convert the input file into text from **the command line**.
**Investigate text language support** and image **preprocessing capabilities** of the tool.
Image preprocessing (like [cropping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropping_%28image%29),
[sharpening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_mask),
[color levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale), ...)
may significantly improve the recognition.

Search the web for what others are doing to solve the same problem. **Read all
basic tutorials** about tesseract-ocr.

Ask your instructors for sample program input.
