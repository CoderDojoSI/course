Learn a new language
====================

[Over 7 billion](http://www.census.gov/popclock/) people are on the planet Earth,
1.3 billion of those are Chinese and 1.2 billion Indian.
Roughly every 2 in 7 people (~28%) speak English, and only about
2 million speak an exotic Slavic language such as Slovene.

Can you imagine those numbers, in scale?

Can you see yourself?

**Learn a new language**! For every new language you learn, you 
**supercharge your brain** and you become overall smarter. By learning another language,
the physiological processes involved **will instantly make you smarter**
than most in your class.
