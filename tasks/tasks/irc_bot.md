Help build our IRC bot
======================

After [you have joined us on IRC](irc.md) and after you have
[sufficient knowledge of Python](python.md), you can help extend the
functionality of our [IRC bot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat_bot).

IRC bots are helpful and fun robots that can:
* keep IRC channels 'alive' when few users are present,
* help channel users to information about the channel or from the Web,
* provide witty remarks...

Task
----
**Decide on some new feature** that you would like the IRC bot to
have that would benefit users on the channel.
Preferrably **discuss this with your mentors**.

Then **clone the [botko repository](https://github.com/CoderDojoSI/botko)** and thoroughly **study the existing code**.

Add decided-upon functionality (write the required new code or source modifications) to your local copy and **test that it works properly**.
Finally, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to merge your modifications
[_upstream_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_%28software_development%29).
