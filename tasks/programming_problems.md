================

Now that you know some basic programming, preferably in
[Python](python.html), solving some real-world problems is in order.

If you're interested in such a thing, on these sites you can find
general problems relevant to the venerable field of **mathematics**:

* [Project Eureka](http://projecteureka.org/)
* [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems)
* [SPhere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/)

Or if those problems prove to be too hard for you to comprehend
(i.e. you are not yet smart enough), try some of these, **easier** ones:

* [TDD Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/all-problems-1)
* [CodingBat Python](http://codingbat.com/python)
* [CheckIO](http://www.checkio.org/)
* [Code Chef Easy Problems](http://www.codechef.com/problems/easy)
* [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)
* [Reddit Daily Programmer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)

Task
----
Solve any problem.

Proportionate to its difficulty, each and every
problem solved counts.
