{{ page.title }}
================

The title is used above as H1 tag as well as page TITLE in HTML source.

Subtitle
--------

This is the markup for `inline code`.

```
Block code is separated from other content by a
**blank line** and ``` on its own line.

Like this block is.
```

Similarly, lists are separated by a blank line from the surrounding content:

* like this,
* which you may dislike,
* but this is Markdown without extensions.

###### Tip ######
If you want to make short notifications, you can use H6 like this.

###### Note ######
The paragraph following H6 title is considered part of the "notification."

###### Warning ######
When you reference a related task with a link, e.g. [Learn Python task](python.html),
the link is actually to a *.html, not *.md file, like this: `[Learn Python task](python.html)`.

###### Remember ######
The standard set of notifications is **Note**, **Tip**, **Remember**, and **Warning**.
Use as appropriate.
