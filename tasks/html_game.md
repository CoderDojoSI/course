* [Build your first game with HTML5 with Box2D library](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/build-your-first-game-with-html5/)

**Follow the tutorials** to get a basic idea of how to create a HTML5
game that runs on canvas (2d "drawing board"). You should be able to
understand and replicate the intended result.

###### Remember ######
If there is **anything** you don't understand, Google it, or just ask your mentors.

When your game looks and works **like the demo**,
try changing stuff and play around with the code!
The more customized, the better for you!
